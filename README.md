# Bop-A-Mole

Welcome to Bop-A-Mole, based upon the classic arcade game 'Whac-A-Mole'. The game objective is to bop as many moles as possible in 60 seconds.

It's a simple, fun, high-energy game which involves concentration, visual perception, hand-eye-coordination and reaction time- all great skills for young children to practice and develop in this exciting, interactive online game.

A fictional story has been created to support the theme of the game and make the game more engaging with young children. Farmer John is fed up of the all of the moles digging up his fields. He needs to catch as many was he can and move them away from his farm. Can you help by bopping the moles when you spot them popping out from a mole hole? If you're too slow they'll hide back in their mole hole. Oh, and watch out for the Venus Fly Trap plants, they bite and you'll lose points!

This game has been designed for ages 5+ but is super fun for the whole family. The rules are simple - bop the moles when you see them pop up out of their mole hill, but be quick! They don't hang around for long and will quickly hide back down in their hole.
           
Instead of the standard 5 mole holes, this game has 9 mole hills, making it a bit more challenging. A mole will pop out of one of the 9 mole hills at random. When you spot the mole, quickly move your cursor over the mole and left-click. If you have managed to bop the mole you will score 10 points, which you will see added to your score tally. Watch out for the biting Venus Fly Traps though! They pop up too and if you accidentally whack one, you will lose 20 points!

You have 60 seconds to try to bop as many moles as you can. When the game is over try and beat your score again! Have fun!!!

This game has been built using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

## Design

-   ### Colour Scheme
    * The colour palette used for Bop-A-Mole sie was created using [coolors](https://coolors.co/user/palettes/65b236f7d1cee1000b93d2d0) ![screenshot of colour palette used](documentation/coolors.png)
    * This colour palette was created from the key colours within the home page image. It uses bright, engaging colours which with increase engagement in children. 
    * There is a range in the colours within the palette so that a good contrast is achieved at all times between text and background-colours.
    * The font-color chosen is black to provide high contrast, making it easy for both young children and adults to read the text on display.

-   ### Typography
    * The "Fuzzy Bubbles" font was chosen as the main font used throughout the site. Sans Serif is the backup font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. "Fuzzy Bubbles" is described as a cute, juvenile, hand-written style font that is playful and perfect for children. It is a user-friendly, clean and easy to read, which is age appropriate to the main target audience and compliments the fun, playful theme of the website.

-   ### Imagery
    * Imagery has an important role in the website. The large, background image on each page is designed to be striking and catch the user's attention. The images were chosen for their outdoors/farm theme to compliment the storyline behind the game. The images aim to be fun, colourful and engaging for young children and adults alike.

## Structure

-   ### Features
    * Responsive on all device sizes from 320px

    -   #### Navigation Bar
        * The responsive navigation bar has been applied to each page so that the pages are uniform, which is more visually appealing and improves user experience. It is also 'sticky' on the home page so that it is visible at all times on this, the main navigation page. It was felt that removing the 'sticky' feature on the Play Game and Abotut pages would improve user experience as it was important that the user have more space to play the game and see the information on these pages. 
        * The navigation bar includes clear links to the Home, Play and About pages.
        * The navigation section promotes ease of use for the user, allowing the user to move easily between sections and pages.
        * The navigation bar was created using Bootstrap 5 and was adapted to meet the needs of the site.  

       ![Navigation Bar - desktop]()

       * On a mobile device the navigation bar utilises a hamburger menu to improve appearance and user experience. The Bootstrap5 nav-bar-toggler class was used to create this.

       ![Navigation Bar- mobile device ]()

       ![Navigation Bar- mobile device- hamburger menu open]()

    -   #### Background Image
        * Each page has a colourful image to entice the user and follows the Farm theme of the game. 
        * The intended primary audience is very young children and according to [designshack:] (https://designshack.net/articles/graphics/website-design-for-kids-tips-and-advice/), this age category respond best to bright colourful imagery, limited text, cute characters and nature themes. Therefore this has been taken into consideration when selecting imagery.

         ![About page](https://chloel-e.github.io/msp2/about.html)

    -    #### How To Play modal
         *  When the How to Play button is clicked on either the Home or the Play page a modal will pop up.
         *  The modal gives the player clear, concise information about the rules of the game.
         *  There is a close button within the modal and when clicked the modal will disappear.

         * 

         ![Footer]()

    -    #### 404 Error Page
          * A 404 error page was created to ensure that if, for any reason, the webpage is unavailable, the user is taken to a message page which helps to redirect them back to the website.

         ![404 error page](https://chloel-e.github.io/msp2/404.html)


-   ### Features For The Future
    * In the future, a scoreboard would be added to the game so that players can easily remember their score and try to beat their own score or that of their friends/family.
    * Different levels of play e.g. beginner, intermediate and advanced levels would help to make the game more adaptable depending on the user or age of user.

    -    #### Validators

         * W3C Markup Validator, W3C CSS Validator Services were used to validate this project to ensure that there were no syntax errors in the project.
         * Markup Validator ![W3C Markup Validator]()
          - Home Page ![W3C Markup Validator]()

    -    #### WAVE accessibility tool

    * The website was developed to be as inclusive as possible. The use of semantic HTML, aria-labelling, alt attributes to images and good colour contrast.
    * The WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool was used to assess each webpage.
    * The Home page identified 2 errors and 1 alert. All were in relation to the audio. The audio icons required labelling for screen readers, in particular the hidden audio pause which is hidden until the icon is clicked. Using MDN webdocs and W3C i improved the accessibility. When reassessed with the WAVE tool, there were no errors identified. ![Wave tool result - home page](documentation/wave-home.png)
    * The Play page identified no errors or contrast errors ![Wave tool result - play page](documentation/wave-play.png)
    * The About page identified no errors or contrast errors. ![Wave tool result - about page](documentation/lighthouse-about.png).
    * Wave tool also identified a contract error in the 'x' close icon on the How to Play modal, this color was changed to black which fixed the error.

    -    #### Lighthouse 

  Lighthouse within the Chrome Developer Tools are used to test performance, accessibility, best practices and SEO of the spa Website.

    - Performance was the only issue and the majority of this is due to the images slowing the load time therfore the images used within the content on Home and Treaments page were converted from jpeg to png files. This improved the performance. The hero images to each page were not converted as it did not improve the performance rating but the image quality reduced.

-   ###  Further Testing

    * The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Internet Explorer and Safari browsers.
    * The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, Tablets and Phones using dev tools and real devices.
    * The website was sent to friends and young family members to review the site and test it from a user perspective.

-   ### Fixed Bugs

    * The moveMole and movePlant functions move the images around the game board using setInterval. However multiple images were appearing one after another. To fix this, the clearInterval method was used and this worked. Now only one of each image apppeared at any one time.
    * A similar bug was found in the resetGame function which is linked to the reset button. I found if i again used the clearInterval method after the setInterval it.
    * Logo didnt appear when website was first depolyed. Checked and confirmed it was using the correct file path. Checked the source code in Developer tools and hadn't loaded the logo image. Re-deployed website but this did not work either. Re-added the image to VS code in new format and this worked.
    * The javascript for the audio/icons worked on the play page but not on the home page. I tried changing the format of the code, moved elements to class from Id but this did not work. Renamed the elements to ensure ids were uniquely named. This did not work either. Troubleshooting done via StackOverflow but this did not provide any correct answers for this particular issue. I rechecked correct file paths and that the jquery script was loading before the main.js file. Blocked out all javascript other than the specific audio function and it worked. I then worked backwards, slowly reintroduced more code. I found that the issue was with the order of execution. Once i had reordered the code correctly, the bug was fixed.
    * The modal that appears when the game is over wouldn't show. 
    * The javascript stopped working after i have written the storyModal. The code i'd written used the same format as the Modal. I checked for errors in the code but couldn't find anything obvious. The code worked in isolation and the rest of my code worked when the StoryModal code was removed. I tried moving the storyModal to the bottom of my code, which fixed the rest of the sites functionality but the storyModal wouldn't open. I did some research and was assited by a post on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11516346/error-in-one-javascript-function-causes-others-to-stop-working). I found that the modal and storyModal were using such similar functions that I could combine them using an if else statements and not only did this streamline my code but it fixed the bug. I also simplified the code using jquery.
