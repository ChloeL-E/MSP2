                    <p>Welcome to Bop-A-Mole, based upon the classic arcade game 'Whac-A-Mole'. The game objective is to
                        bop as many moles as possible in 60 seconds.
                    <p>Farmer John needs you help!!! He is fed up of the all of the moles digging up his fields. He
                        needs to catch as many was he can and move them away from his farm. Can you help by bopping the 
                        moles when you spot them popping out from a mole hill? If you're too slow they'll hide back in their mole hill. 
                        Oh, and watch out for the pesky Venus Fly Trap plants, they bite and you'll lose points!
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Instead of the standard 5 mole holes, this game has 9 mole hills, making it a bit more
                        challenging. A mole will pop out of one of the 9 mole hills at random. When you spot the mole,
                        quickly move your cursor over the mole and left-click.
                        If you have managed to bop the mole you will score 10 points, which you will see
                        added to your score tally. Watch out for the biting Venus Fly Traps though! They pop up too and
                        if you accidentally whack one, you will lose 20 points! You have 60 seconds to try to bop as
                        many moles as you can. When the game is over try and beat your score again! Have fun!!!
                    </p>
